## Description

This simple C program demonstrates basic input and output operations, type casting, and formatting. Specifically, the program does the following:

- Reads an `int`, `double`, `char`, and `string` from user input
- Prints the entered values in the original input order
- Prints the values again in reverse order
- Casts the `double` to an `int` and displays the result

This serves as a beginner-level exercise for practicing the `scanf` and `printf` functions in C.
