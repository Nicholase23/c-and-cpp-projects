This C program helps users calculate:
- The **periodic payment** required to pay off a loan.
- The **unpaid balance** remaining after a given number of payments.

It uses standard amortization formulas and prompts the user for:
- Loan amount
- Annual interest rate (as a percentage)
- Number of payments per year
- Loan term in years
- Number of payments made

The program repeats as long as the user wants to calculate more loan scenarios.
